About Joomla!

Joomla! is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) for publishing web content. 
Over the years Joomla! has won several awards. 
It is built on a model–view–controller web application framework that can be used independently of the CMS that allows you to build powerful online applications.

What's a content management system (CMS)?

The definition of a CMS is an application (web-based), that provides capabilities for multiple users with different permission levels to manage (all or a section of) content, data or information of a website project, or intranet application.
Managing content refers to creating, editing, archiving, publishing, collaborating on, reporting, distributing website content, data and information.

Being a web agency, how can Joomla! help me?

If you’re an agency who develops websites for your customers, Joomla! is the perfect tool for you (have a look at our benefits and features). Designed to be easy to install and set up, even if you're not an advanced user. With a short learning curve (we provide free video training as well) you’ll be able to quickly build sites for your clients. Then, with a minimal amount of instruction, you can empower your clients to easily manage their own sites themselves.
If your clients need specialised functionality, Joomla! is highly extensible and thousands of extensions (most for free under the GPL license) are available in the Joomla! Extensions Directory.
As a developer, can I use Joomla! in a more advanced way?

Some companies and organisations have requirements that go beyond what is available in the Joomla! Core package. In those cases, Joomla's powerful application framework makes it easy for developers to create sophisticated add-ons that extend the power of Joomla into virtually unlimited directions.

The core Joomla! Framework enables developers to quickly and easily build:

    Inventory control systems
    Data reporting tools
    Application bridges
    Custom product catalogs
    Integrated e-commerce systems
    Complex business directories
    Reservation systems
    Communication tools

Since Joomla! is based on PHP and MySQL, you're building powerful applications on an open platform anyone can use, share, and support.
